## About

The Discord bot called "Vylune" aims to bring Indomni-Owl's envisioned character Vylune to life by using a neural network in form of a role-playing chatbot. The bot aims to act and behave like the fictional character. Whenever a user tags the bot by using the Discord `@` command, it is possible to interact with the bot to ask questions.

This bot is made as a hobby to explore new technologies and to experiment with different libraries and tools.

## Capabilities

Currently the bot support the following functionalities:
- **Join To Private VC**: By joining a specific voice channel, the bot will create a temporary voice channel for the user. Once the voice channel is empty, the bot will delete it.
- **Say as the bot**: By using a `/` (slash) command, an authorized user, who has a specific role, can issue the bot to write a message in a text channel as if the bot would have said it.
- **Chat**: When the user tags the bot by using the `@` symbol, a user can talk with the bot. Their message will be sent to the bot's neural network to figure out an answer to send.
